Looping Through The Inventory
You can loop through the Inventory file to list all hosts or hosts from a play, using with_items with the play_hosts or groups variables,
# show all the hosts in the inventory
- debug:
    msg: "{{ item }}"
  with_items:
    - "{{ groups['all'] }}"

# show all the hosts in the current play
- debug:
    msg: "{{ item }}"
  with_items:
    - "{{ play_hosts }}"
