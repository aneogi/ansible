Conditionals - When Clause...

    You can group conditions using parenthesis ()

tasks:
  - name: "shutdown CentOS 6 and Debian 7 systems"
    command: /sbin/shutdown -t now
    when: (ansible_distribution == "CentOS" and ansible_distribution_major_version == "6") or
          (ansible_distribution == "Debian" and ansible_distribution_major_version == "7")+

    You can define multiple conditions, where all of them should be true to execute the tasks

tasks:
  - name: "shut down CentOS 6 systems"
    command: /sbin/shutdown -t now
    when:
      - ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
      - ansible_distribution_major_version == "6"
