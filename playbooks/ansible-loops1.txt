If you need to repeat the same task with different items (loop through), you can use with_items clause
For example, consider you want to add several users
- name: add several users
  user:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
    groups: "developer"
  with_items:
    - raj
    - david
    - john
    - lauren
